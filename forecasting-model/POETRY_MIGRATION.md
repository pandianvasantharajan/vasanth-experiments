# Poetry Migration Summary

## âœ… Successfully migrated from requirements.txt to Poetry!

### What was changed:

1. **Removed**: `requirements.txt`
2. **Added**: `pyproject.toml` with comprehensive Poetry configuration
3. **Added**: Development workflow files:
   - `.gitignore` (Poetry-specific)
   - `.env.example` (Environment variables template)
   - `Makefile` (Common development commands)

### Benefits of using Poetry:

- **Dependency Resolution**: Poetry resolves dependencies automatically
- **Lock File**: `poetry.lock` ensures reproducible builds
- **Virtual Environment**: Automatic virtual environment management
- **Development Dependencies**: Separate dev/test dependencies
- **Build System**: Ready for packaging and distribution
- **Tool Configuration**: All Python tool configs in one file

### Key commands to remember:

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Activate shell
poetry shell

# Add new dependencies
poetry add package-name

# Add dev dependencies
poetry add --group dev package-name

# Run commands in the environment
poetry run jupyter notebook

# Update dependencies
poetry update

# Use Makefile shortcuts
make install
make notebook
make format
make lint
```

### Environment setup verified:
- Poetry virtual environment created
- All core packages installed successfully
- Jupyter notebook ready to run
- Development tools configured

The forecasting project is now fully migrated to Poetry and ready for development! ðŸš€
