## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.9 or higher
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management

**Install Poetry** (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
# Add to PATH: export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

**Set up the project:**
```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd forecasting-model

# Install all dependencies (including dev dependencies)
poetry install

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell

# Alternative: run commands with poetry run
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

### 2. Run the Analysis

```bash
# Start Jupyter notebook
poetry run jupyter notebook

# Or if you activated the shell:
jupyter notebook

# Open and run the main notebook
# notebooks/air_temperature_forecasting.ipynb
```

### 3. Development Commands

```bash
# Install new dependencies
poetry add package-name

# Install development dependencies
poetry add --group dev package-name

# Update dependencies
poetry update

# Run code formatting
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .

# Run linting
poetry run flake8

# Run tests
poetry run pytest

# Run type checking
poetry run mypy .
```

### 3. View Results

## Model Performance

The notebook implements and compares multiple approaches:

| Model Type | Advantages | Use Case |
|------------|------------|----------|
| **Baseline** | Simple, fast, interpretable | Quick prototyping, benchmarking |
| **ARIMA** | Captures temporal dependencies | Statistical analysis, trend understanding |
| **Random Forest** | Feature importance, robust | Good balance of accuracy and interpretability |
| **XGBoost** | High accuracy, handles non-linearity | Production forecasting systems |
| **LSTM** | Captures complex patterns | Long-term dependencies, complex data |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Forecasting
```python
# Load the trained model
model = load_model('models/best_model.pkl')

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)

# Evaluate
metrics = calculate_metrics(actual, predictions)
```

### Custom Feature Engineering
```python
# Add custom features
df['custom_feature'] = create_custom_feature(df)

# Retrain models with new features
retrain_models(df, feature_list)
```

## Data Requirements

The system expects hourly temperature data with the following format:

```
datetime,temperature
2019-01-01 00:00:00,5.2
2019-01-01 01:00:00,4.8
...
```

**Required columns:**
- `datetime`: Timestamp in ISO format
- `temperature`: Air temperature in Celsius
