## Model Summary
This comprehensive climate forecasting analysis includes:

### 1. Data Analysis & Preprocessing
- Jena Climate Dataset (2009-2016)
- 70,000+ hourly observations
- 14 meteorological features
- Comprehensive EDA and stationarity analysis

### 2. Forecasting Models Implemented
- **ARIMA Models**: Automated grid search with optimal (5,1,1) configuration
- **Prophet Models**: Both univariate and multivariate implementations
- **VAR Models**: Vector autoregression for multivariate analysis
- **Baseline Methods**: Naive, seasonal naive, moving averages
- **Exponential Smoothing**: Simple, Holt, and Holt-Winters methods

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Multiple forecast horizons (1-hour, 6-hour, 1-day, 3-day)
- Comprehensive metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
- Statistical validation and residual analysis
- Performance comparison across all models

### 4. Key Results
- ARIMA (5,1,1) showed optimal performance for short-term forecasting
- Prophet models effective for longer horizons with seasonal patterns
- Comprehensive visualization of forecasts and model diagnostics

### 5. Technical Implementation
- Python 3.13.1 with scientific computing stack
- Statsmodels, Prophet, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook with 35+ code cells
- Complete reproducible analysis pipeline
